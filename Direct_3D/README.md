# 3D CNN with no warping

This model architecture experiments with using a 3D CNN to directly learn to do image warping. So rather than doing a geometrically based image warping and using a CNN to improve it, this experiments with directly learning image warping. It is likely that this will not be fruitful, but it is an interesting experiment.
